# Basic concepts of waves and wave motion:

- Radian unit of measurement:

    If we draw a circle with radius 1 unit, and then draw an arc that is also 1 unit long, then the angle
    covered at the center of the circle is 1 radian.

    So for a circle the circumfrence = 2 * π * radius 
    or we can say there are 2π radians in a circle.

    so For circle we have (360°), and 
        1 radian =  (360° / 2π) = (180° / π)≈ 57.3°

=> Radian is a unit of measurement for angles.
It's defined as the angle subtended  at the center of circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius
of circle.

Uses: Used in math, physics, trigonometry. And mainly in wave motion.



- Phase:  

    In terms of waves is the measure of the wave's position in its cycle. Its way to describe the wave's
    "timing" or "alignment" with respect to a reference point.

    Imagine a wave as a sinusoidal curve: The phase of the wave is determined where on the curve the wave is
    at a given time.
    Example:

    - If the phase is 0, wave is at at zero-crossing point (amplitude = 0), and its about to go rise to its
      peak.
    - If the phase is π/2, the wave is at its peak (max amplititude).
    - If the phase is π, the wave is at its zero-crossing (amp = 0) and it's about to fall to its trough.
    - If the phase is 3π/2, the wave is at its trough (minimum amplitude).

    => the sqeuence of wave :
        0 → rising to peak (π/2) → falling to zero (π) → falling to trough (3π/2) → rising to zero (2π)

    Phase is typically measured in radians, and its often denoted by the symbol 'phy' = φ 


- Wave Number (k) : Its defined as the number of waves that can fit in a unit length.

    measured in meters,
    gives a idea of how many waves fir within a certain distance.

    - Wave Number describes the spatial frequency of a wave.

    - Mathematical representation:
        (k) is related to the wavelength (λ) of the wave by the following equation:

        k = 2π / λ

        where k is the wave number, λ is the wavelength, and π ~ 3.14.


    Inference:
        Higher wave number = Higher frequency = Shorter wavelength.
        Lower wave number = Lower frequency = Longer wavelength.

    Units:
        Measured in meters (m)
        or 
        radians per meter (rad/m)
        or 
        expressed in units of inverse meters (m⁻¹) 
        or 
        inverse centimeters (cm⁻¹)

    ex: A wave with a wavelength of 10 centimeters (cm) has a wave number of 20π radians per meter (rad/m).

    Importance:

    Optics: Wave number are used to describe the behaviour of light and other EM waves.

    Acoustics: Used to describe the behaviour of sound waves.

    Quantum Mechanics: Wave number is used to describe the behaviour of particles at the atomic and
    subatomic level.

- Representing wave motion in terms of phase and radians:

    Example: Mathematically a Simple wave can be writen  using the equation:

        y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)

    - y(x,t) is the wave's amplitude at position x and time t
    - A is the max amplitude
    - k is wave number( related to wavelength )
    - ω is the angular frequency (related to the frequency)
    - φ is the phase of the wave (measured in radians)
    - x is the position along the wave
    - t is time

    (kx - ωt + φ) = this term represents the phase of the wave at position 'x' and time 't'.

    If phase is φ = π/2, the wave will be shifted by 90° (or π/2 radians) relative to the reference point.

Representing the phase of a wave this way it can easily perfom mathematical operations and analyze wave
behaviour using trigonometric functions.
